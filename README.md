cloom - Command-Line Outgoing Outlook Mail 
==========================================

A hack to make my life much easier given that I like to send mail from the
command line and I'm forced to use an Outlook server for outgoing mail.

It is just a coincidence that "cloom" looks a bit like "doom", even though
that's how I sometimes feel using an Outlook server.
